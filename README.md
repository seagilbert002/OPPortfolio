An Example Software Design Document


Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was 
the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The Gaming Room client was seeking to create a version of their Android mobile 
game compatible with all major operating systems, mobile platforms, and a web 
version. They envisioned a seamless cross-platform experience, enabling players 
on any platform to interact and play with those on other platforms.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

I believe my analysis of the different server options available to the
development team was the most comprehensives section I made. I thouroughly 
researched and evaluated various server platforms, considering factors such as 
scalability, cost, security, and compatibility with the existing infrastructure. 
This detailed analysis ensured the team had a solid foundation for making an 
informed decision.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

I found the model section to be the most helpful to developing the code. It gave 
me a clear guide on what to create the various classes and structures needed for 
the software project.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise what would 
you pick? How would you improve it?

I would likely choose to be more thorough in the Design Constraints section. I 
believe I left a bit of ambiguity in that section and I would addressed by adding 
more specific rationales and how they might influence design decisions.

How did you interpret the user's needs and implement them into your software 
design? Why is is so important to consider the user's needs when designing?

I made sure the game would function according to their desires. 

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you 
use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

Will definitely be using design documents in the future. Even when creating my 
own programs I plan to use a design document because the functionality allows me 
to anticipate problems before they occur.
